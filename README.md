# Risk Model Builder

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to showcase my full-stack web development skills.

The project is composed of the following components:

* [Risk Model API](risk_model_api/): A restful service implemented with [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) (a back-end service).

* [Risk Model UI](risk_model_ui/): A single page application developed using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) (a front-end service).

Just follow the links for more information on each component.
